summary: "While millions of public dollars are going for bike lanes in Seattle, the city's data collection on actual bike-lane ridership is scattered and incomplete. Given they're the best the public can get, here's what those numbers can tell us about who's riding where."

## Introduction

From the article on [Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/what-we-can-learn-from-seattles-bike-counter-data/) - 

"While millions of public dollars are going for bike lanes in Seattle, the city's data collection on actual bike-lane ridership is scattered and incomplete. Given they're the best the public can get, here's what those numbers can tell us about who's riding where."

## Analysis

### What directions do people commute by bike?

         )) %>%

           direction,
           commute) %>%

```
