# Introduction

From the article on [Mistakes, we’ve drawn a few](https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368) - 

"At The Economist, we take data visualisation seriously. Every week we publish around 40 charts across print, the website and our apps. With every single one, we try our best to visualise the numbers accurately and in a way that best supports the story. But sometimes we get it wrong. We can do better in future if we learn from our mistakes — and other people may be able to learn from them, too."

Here I will try and draw the improved plots as suggested by the article on economist or make a version I think is best. 
All this done towards the weekly social data project [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-04-16).
