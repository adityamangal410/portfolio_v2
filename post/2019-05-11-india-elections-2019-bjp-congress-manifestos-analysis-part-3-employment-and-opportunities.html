  discussions in both manifestos.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>With India’s 2019 General Elections around the corner, I thought it’d be a good idea to analyse the election manifestos of its 2 biggest political parties, BJP and Congress. Let’s use text mining to understand what each party promises and prioritizes.<br />
In this part 4, I’ll explore the Anti-corruption and Good Governance discussions in both manifestos.</p>

<p>Police is the most basic and key functionary affecting the people’s life. An effective policing and peaceful law and order is the key to growth and development. Our present police and policing is based upon the colonial police force and there is a need to change and transform the police according to the challenges of the 21st century.Therefore, we will bring Police Reform. We will formulate a ‘Model Police Act’ in consultation with the States to have a pro-people citizen friendly police.
