summary: With India's 2019 General Elections around the corner, I thought it'd be
  a good idea to analyse the election manifestos of its 2 biggest political parties,

  miscellaneous discussions in both manifestos.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>With India’s 2019 General Elections around the corner, I thought it’d be a good idea to analyse the election manifestos of its 2 biggest political parties, BJP and Congress. Let’s use text mining to understand what each party promises and prioritizes.<br />

<p>We consider it our duty to provide a conducive environment for talented children in our country to facilitate them to unleash their talent. For this, we will initiate a ‘Prime Minister Innovative Learning Program’ to bring together such children for a certain period in a year in one place from all over the country and provide them with facilities and resources for them to excel.

<p>Congress will take suitable measures to ensure that the Constitution of each sports body is in accordance with certain norms and principles, that elections are held according to them, and that there is adequate representation in each sports body for active players, former players and women.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With all the above analysis, we have developed some idea about the Education, Healthcare and other miscellaneous plans of the 2 parties.</p>
<p>With this I conclude my analysis of the manifestos of BJP and Congress for 2019 general elections. I highly encourage all my readers to make their choice carefully in these pivotal elections and even though these analyses give you a high level idea about each party, maybe try and go through the entire manifestos to make a much informed decision about your choice and ensure accountability from our governments.</p>
<p>Let’s hope for and build a better India. All the best!</p>
