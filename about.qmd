Hello! I'm **Aditya Mangal**. I'm currently working in the Search & Discovery Team at Roblox building the richest Recommendations Platform. Previously, I worked in the Location Center of Excellence at Yahoo. I'm originally from India and have been living in the San Francisco Bay Area for the past few years. I love blogging about Data Science and Machine Learning. Java was my first love and R/Python are competing for a close second. In an ideal world, I'd also share my musings about travel and photography here. If you have questions or feedback, feel free to reach out at [adityamangal410@yahoo.co.in](mailto:adityamangal410@yahoo.co.in).
