# Introduction

With India’s 2019 General Elections around the corner, I thought it’d be
a good idea to analyse the election manifestos of its 2 biggest
political parties, BJP and Congress. Let’s use text mining to understand
what each party promises and prioritizes.  
In this part 3, I’ll explore the Employment and opportunities
discussions in both manifestos.

# Analysis

## Employment and Opportunities

This topic is covered congress’ manifesto from Pages 6 to 8 of the pdf
and in that of bjp’s from pages 20 to 22 and 27 to 28.

<div id="cb3" class="sourceCode">

                                         stop_words_list = stop_words) {
  set.seed(123)

## Basic Search Engine

Lets build a cosine-similarity based simple search engine (instead of
the basic keyword-based search that comes with the pdf document), in
order to make these documents more easily searchable and gain context
using most related lines in the manifestos for a given query. Using
python’s scikit-learn for this.

<div id="cb9" class="sourceCode">

``` sourcecode
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer, ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel

stopwords = ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS

vectorizer_bjp = TfidfVectorizer(analyzer=&#39;word&#39;, stop_words=stopwords, max_df=0.3, min_df=2)
vector_train_bjp = vectorizer_bjp.fit_transform(r[&quot;bjp_content$text&quot;])

vectorizer_congress = TfidfVectorizer(analyzer=&#39;word&#39;, stop_words=stopwords, max_df=0.3, min_df=2)
vector_train_congress = vectorizer_congress.fit_transform(r[&quot;congress_content$text&quot;])

def get_related_lines(query, party=&quot;bjp&quot;):
  if (party == &quot;bjp&quot;):
    vectorizer = vectorizer_bjp
    vector_train = vector_train_bjp
  else:
    vectorizer = vectorizer_congress
    vector_train = vector_train_congress
  vector_query = vectorizer.transform([query])
  cosine_sim = linear_kernel(vector_query, vector_train).flatten()
  return cosine_sim.argsort()[:-10:-1]
```

</div>

<div id="cb10" class="sourceCode">

``` sourcecode
get_related_lines &lt;- py_to_r(py$get_related_lines)
```

</div>

### Common Popular Words with both BJP & Congress

As we see from the plot above, one of the most popular words in both BJP
and Congress’ manifesto for Employment and Opportunities is
“electricity”. Lets see, what each of them have planned for that. First,
BJP.

<div id="cb11" class="sourceCode">

``` sourcecode
bjp_content %&gt;% 
  slice(get_related_lines(&quot;electricity&quot;, party = &quot;bjp&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  select(text, page, line)
```

</div>

    ## # A tibble: 9 x 3
    ##   text                                                                page  line
    ##   &lt;chr&gt;                                                              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
    ## 1 promise in a record time. we will fu her work towards completing …    22    19

    ## 4 energy                                                                22    15

    ## 9 approach the issue of water management holistically and ensure be…    21     4

This is the excerpt that we find from page 22, as we dug up based on
above results -

> Now, we will work towards:  
> - Ensuring a right mix of energy which leads towards a cleaner
> environment.  
> - Supplying quality electricity to all consumers.  
> - Making the state electricity entities financially sound and
> administratively more efficient.

Now, Congress.

<div id="cb13" class="sourceCode">

``` sourcecode
congress_content %&gt;% 
  slice(get_related_lines(&quot;electricity&quot;, party = &quot;congress&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  select(text, page, line)
```

</div>

    ## # A tibble: 9 x 3
    ##   text                                                                page  line
    ##   &lt;chr&gt;                                                              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;

One of the full excerpts from page 8 related to above results -

> Congress promises to enhance availability of, and access to,
> electricity in rural areas by encour- aging investment in off-grid
> renewable power generation with ownership and revenues vesting in
> local bodies. Every village and every home will be electrified in the
> true sense. In the long term, we aim to substitute LPG used in homes
> by electricity and solar energy.

### Unique popular words with BJP & Congress

One of the popular words that seems curious from BJP’s manifesto is
“youth”. Let’s see what BJP has planned for the youth employment
opportunities.

<div id="cb15" class="sourceCode">

``` sourcecode
bjp_content %&gt;% 
  slice(get_related_lines(&quot;youth&quot;, party = &quot;bjp&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  select(text, page, line)
```

</div>

    ## # A tibble: 9 x 3
    ##   text                                                                page  line
    ##   &lt;chr&gt;                                                              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
    ## 1 a country with such a major                                           28    13
    ## 2 youth in governance                                                   27    20
    ## 3 ₹20,000 crore.                                                        27    19

    ## 5 the following steps :                                                 27    22
    ## 6 protect them from the harmful e ects of substance abuse and addic…    27    27
    ## 7 more fully in building new india.                                     27     3
    ## 8 take advantage of the oppo unities available in domestic and fore…    27     8
    ## 9 greater civic engagement of the youth.                                27    25

An excerpt from BJP’s manifesto about youth employment opportunities as
identified from above -

> We will incentivise and reward self-organized groups of youth who
> adopt social assets like schools, hospitals, lakes, public gardens
> etc. and ensure their maintenance and cleanliness to encourage greater
> civic engagement of the youth.

Now, one of the popular words that seems curious from Congress’
manifesto is “tourism”.

<div id="cb17" class="sourceCode">

``` sourcecode
congress_content %&gt;% 
  slice(get_related_lines(&quot;tourism&quot;, party = &quot;congress&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  select(text, page, line)
```

</div>

    ## # A tibble: 9 x 3
    ##   text                                                                page  line
    ##   &lt;chr&gt;                                                              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;

A surprisingly large amount of mention of the word
“business”/“businesses” in this section of Congress’ manifesto.

With all the above analysis, we have developed some idea about the
Employment and Opportunities plans of the 2 parties. In the next post,
I’ll do a similar analysis for Anti-Corruption and Good Governance
proposals by them.

Stay Tuned!
