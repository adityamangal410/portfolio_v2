marimo lets you create reactive notebooks that run entirely in the browser using WebAssembly. Below is a simple example built with [`marimo`](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) and [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/).

```python
{# Setup}
!include-tools "tools/marimo_demo.py"
```

You can export this notebook to a single self-contained HTML file with:

```bash
marimo export tools/marimo_demo.py --output marimo-demo.html
```

Then embed `marimo-demo.html` in your Quarto post via an `<iframe>`:

```{=html}
<iframe src="marimo-demo.html" width="100%" height="400"></iframe>
```

Give it a try! Use the slider to update the plotted squares interactivelyâ€”all executed right in your browser via Pyodide.
