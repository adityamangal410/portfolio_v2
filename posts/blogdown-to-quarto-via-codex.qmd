summary: How ChatGPT Codex rewrote **\~30 000 lines** to move this site from Blogdown to Quarto with almost no babysitting.

> **TL;DR** — I pointed ChatGPT Codex at my creaky Blogdown repo, queued up tasks before crashing for the night, and over the next two days mostly just hammered **Merge** between coffee sips. \~30 k lines later, barely a dozen manual tweaks, and a brand‑new publishing workflow. Here’s the behind‑the‑scenes play‑by‑play. ⚡️

## Why bother leaving Blogdown?

* **Hugo upgrades kept breaking things** — every minor version bump felt like roulette.
* **RMarkdown felt dated** — Quarto’s native support for `.qmd`, citations, call‑outs and reveal.js slides gave me FOMO.
* **Better dev UX** — live reload, built‑in filters, cross‑format publishing… yes please.

But the migration guide was *long* and I’d rather spend weekends with my toddler than hunt down broken shortcodes. Enter Codex.

## Meet ChatGPT Codex, my midnight intern 🤖

Codex’s new *Tasks* UI lets you fire off bite‑sized coding jobs, watch the diffs roll in, and click **Merge** when things look good. The whole session felt like pairing with a hyper‑caffeinated junior dev who *never* tires.

*Text rendering got sharper, code blocks gained copy buttons, and dark‑mode just works.*

I also refreshed the **about** page, swapped the typography, and finally made that category tag clickable:

\::: {.columns}
\::: {.column width="50%"}

## The playbook (so you can steal it)

1. **Spin up a disposable branch** and point Netlify at it for instant previews.
2. In Codex, create tasks for each mile‑stone:

   ```text
   ▸ Fix Netlify build failure due to missing `quarto`
   ▸ Make category tag clickable on blog page
   ▸ Copy styling from distill.pub
   ▸ Add deployment instructions for non‑master branch
   …
   ```
3. Let Codex generate the patch ➜ skim the diff ➜ hit **Merge**.
4. Refresh Netlify preview (`https://6849c31fdb95ff00081f7bcb--upbeat-knuth-c15bbd.netlify.app`) and run a quick click‑test.
5. Rinse ↻ repeat until `git log --oneline | wc -l == 0` scares you. 😂

## What Codex nailed ✅

* **Bulk file surgery** — converted every `*.Rmd` to `*.qmd` *and* updated the front‑matter.
* **Static asset shuffle** — reorganised images into `/static/img/` and fixed all links.
* **Netlify plumbing** — added a one‑liner `publish` step to the CI pipeline.

## Where I still had to step in 🩺

| Issue                                           | Fix                                                 | Time  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Missing **quarto** binary on Netlify build      | Added `netlify.toml` with `PACKAGE_VERSION` env var | 5 min |
| A rogue `weird block` rendering in *About* page | Removed leftover HTML comment                       | 2 min |
| YouTube iframe width hard‑coded                 | Swapped to responsive `.quarto-video` div           | 3 min |

Total human effort: **< 30 min**.

## Lessons learned 🧠

* **Granular tasks beat one mega‑prompt** — easier to debug and revert.
* **Preview early, preview often** — Netlify URLs were my guard‑rails.
* **Codex loves patterns** — once it saw two `.Rmd` conversions, it blitzed through the rest.

## Ready to vibe‑code your own migration?

Quarto’s docs are excellent, but if you’re allergic to boilerplate, unleash Codex. Two hours of task wrangling → a modern static site generator, *and* you get to brag about an AI pair‑programmer.
