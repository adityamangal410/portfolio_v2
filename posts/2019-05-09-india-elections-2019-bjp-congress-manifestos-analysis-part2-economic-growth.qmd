# Introduction
<p>With India’s 2019 General Elections around the corner, I thought it’d be a good idea to analyse the election manifestos of its 2 biggest political parties, BJP and Congress. Let’s use text mining to understand what each party promises and prioritizes.<br />
In this part 2, I’ll explore the Economic Growth discussions in both manifestos.</p>

<pre class="r"><code>bjp_content %&gt;%

## Basic Search Engine
<p>Lets build a cosine-similarity based simple search engine (instead of the basic keyword-based search that comes with the pdf document), in order to make these documents more easily searchable and gain context using most related lines in the manifestos for a given query.
Using python’s scikit-learn for this.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer, ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel

stopwords = ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS

vectorizer_bjp = TfidfVectorizer(analyzer=&#39;word&#39;, stop_words=stopwords, max_df=0.3, min_df=2)
vector_train_bjp = vectorizer_bjp.fit_transform(r[&quot;bjp_content$text&quot;])

vectorizer_congress = TfidfVectorizer(analyzer=&#39;word&#39;, stop_words=stopwords, max_df=0.3, min_df=2)
vector_train_congress = vectorizer_congress.fit_transform(r[&quot;congress_content$text&quot;])

def get_related_lines(query, party=&quot;bjp&quot;):
  if (party == &quot;bjp&quot;):
    vectorizer = vectorizer_bjp
    vector_train = vector_train_bjp
  else:
    vectorizer = vectorizer_congress
    vector_train = vector_train_congress
  vector_query = vectorizer.transform([query])
  cosine_sim = linear_kernel(vector_query, vector_train).flatten()
  return cosine_sim.argsort()[:-10:-1]</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>get_related_lines &lt;- py_to_r(py$get_related_lines)</code></pre>
### Common Popular Words with both BJP &amp; Congress
<p>As we see from the plot above, one of the most popular words in both BJP and Congress’ manifesto for economy growth is “farmers”. Lets see, what each of them have planned for our farmers. First, BJP.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bjp_content %&gt;% 
  slice(get_related_lines(&quot;farmer&quot;, party = &quot;bjp&quot;)) %&gt;%

##   &lt;chr&gt;                                                              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;

## 3 and strengthen them.                                                  14    17

<p>This is the excerpt that we find from page 13, as we dug up based on above results -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warehouse Network across the Country - We will build an efficient storage and transport mechanism for agricultural produce.<br />
- Our Pradhan Mantri Krishi SAMPADA Yojana highlights our focus on warehousing as a means of increasing farmers’ income. To further expand the warehousing infrastructure in the country, we will establish a National Warehousing Grid along National Highways to ensure necessary logistical linkages for warehousing of agricultural produce.<br />
- To enable the farmer to store the agri-produce near his village and sell at a remunerative price at an appropriate time, we will roll out a new Village Storage Scheme of agri-produce. We will provide farmers with loans at cheaper rates on the basis of storage receipt of the agri-produce.</p>

<p>Now, Congress.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>congress_content %&gt;%

<p>Congress promises to establish a permanent National Commission on Agricultural Devel- opment and Planning consisting of farmers, agricultural scientists and agricultural economists to examine and advise the government on how to make agriculture viable, competitive and remuner- ative. The recommendations of the Commission shall be ordinarily binding on the government. The Commission will subsume the existing Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices and recommend appropriate minimum support prices.</p>
</blockquote>
### Unique popular words with BJP &amp; Congress
<p>One of the popular words that seems curious from BJP’s manifesto is “technology”. Let’s see what BJP has planned for the use of technology for economic growth.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bjp_content %&gt;% 
  slice(get_related_lines(&quot;technology&quot;, party = &quot;bjp&quot;)) %&gt;%

<p>An excerpt from BJP’s manifesto about use of technology as identified from above -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will enable development of young agri-scientists to take advantage of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Blockchain Technology, Big Data Analytics etc. for more predictive and profitable precision agriculture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suprising to see mention of plans for usage of Machine Learning and Blockchain in BJP’s manifesto.</p>
<p>Now, one of the popular words that seems curious from Congress’ manifesto is “gst”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>congress_content %&gt;% 
  slice(get_related_lines(&quot;gst&quot;, party = &quot;congress&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  select(text, page, line)</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>MSMEs were badly hit by demonetisation and a flawed GST. Congress promises to devise a rehabilitation plan for MSMEs that were severely affected and help them revive and grow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congress is planning for a rehabilitation program for the Micro Small &amp; Medium Enterprises. They also have a plan to redefine MSMEs -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MSMEs account for 90 per cent of all employment outside agriculture. The definition of MSMEs based on capital employed is biased against labour. Congress will link the definition of MSME to employment. A business employing 10 persons or less will be ‘micro;’ between 11 and 100 will be ‘small;’ and between 101 and 500 will be ‘medium.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With all the above analysis, we have developed some idea about the economic growth plans of the 2 parties. In the next post, I’ll do a similar analysis for employment and opportunites proposals of them.</p>
<p>Stay Tuned!</p>
