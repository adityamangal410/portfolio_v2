# Introduction
With India’s 2019 General Elections around the corner, I thought it’d be a good idea to analyse the election manifestos of its 2 biggest political parties, BJP and Congress. Let’s use text mining to understand what each party promises and prioritizes.
In this part 6, I’ll explore the National Security discussions in both manifestos.

# Analysis

## Load libraries
```r
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(pdftools)
library(tidylog)
library(hunspell)
library(tidytext)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(scales)
library(reticulate)
library(widyr)
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)

theme_set(theme_light())
use_condaenv("stanford-nlp")
```

## Read cleaned data
```r
bjp_content <- read_csv("../data/indian_election_2019/bjp_manifesto_clean.csv")
congress_content <- read_csv("../data/indian_election_2019/congress_manifesto_clean.csv")
```

## National Security
This topic is covered congress’ manifesto from Pages 13 to 16 of the pdf and in that of bjp’s from pages 11 to 12 and 38 to 39.
```r
bjp_content %>%
  filter(between(page, 11, 12) | between(page, 38, 39)) -> bjp_content

congress_content %>%
  filter(between(page, 13, 16)) -> congress_content
```

## Most Popular Words
```r
plot_most_popular_words <- function(df,
                                    min_count = 15,
                                    stop_words_list = stop_words) {
  df %>%
    unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
    anti_join(stop_words_list) %>%
    mutate(word = str_extract(word, "[a-z']+")) %>%
    filter(!is.na(word)) %>%
    count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
    filter(str_length(word) > 1,
           n > min_count) %>%
    mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
    ggplot( aes(x=word, y=n)) +
    geom_segment( aes(x=word, xend=word, y=0, yend=n), color="skyblue", size=1) +
    geom_point( color="blue", size=4, alpha=0.6) +
    coord_flip() +
    theme(panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
          legend.position="none") -> p

  return(p)
}
```
```r
custom_stop_words <- bind_rows(tibble(word = c("india", "country", "bjp", "congress", "government"),
                                          lexicon = rep("custom", 5)),
                               stop_words)
```
```r
bjp_content %>%
  plot_most_popular_words(min_count = 6,
                          stop_words_list = custom_stop_words) +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "Number of Occurences",
       title = "Most popular words related to National Security in BJP's Manifesto",
       subtitle = "Words occurring more than 6 times",
       caption = "Based on election 2019 manifesto from bjp.org") -> p_bjp

congress_content %>%
  plot_most_popular_words(min_count = 10,
                          stop_words_list = custom_stop_words) +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "Number of Occurences",
       title = "Most popular words related to National Security in Congress' Manifesto",
       subtitle = "Words occurring more than 10 times",
       caption = "Based on election 2019 manifesto from inc.in") -> p_congress

grid.arrange(p_bjp, p_congress, ncol = 2, widths = c(10,10))
```

## Common correlated words
```r
plot_common_correlated_words <- function(df,
                                         counts_quantile = 0.7,
                                         correlation_threshold = 0.25,
                                         stop_words_list = stop_words) {
  set.seed(123)
  df %>%
    unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
    anti_join(stop_words_list) %>%
    add_count(word) %>%
    filter(n > stats::quantile(n, counts_quantile)) %>%
    pairwise_cor(word, page, sort = TRUE) %>%
    filter(correlation > correlation_threshold,
         !str_detect(item1, "\\d"),
         !str_detect(item2, "\\d")) %>%
    graph_from_data_frame() %>%
    ggraph(layout = "fr") +
    geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = correlation), show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_node_point(color = "lightblue", size = 5) +
    geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE) +
    theme_void() -> p

  return(p)
}
```
```r
bjp_content %>%
  plot_common_correlated_words(stop_words_list = custom_stop_words,
                               counts_quantile = 0.85) +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "",
       title = "Commonly Occurring Correlated Words in BJP's Manifesto",
       subtitle = "Per page correlation higher than 0.25",
       caption = "Based on election 2019 manifesto from bjp.org") -> p_bjp

congress_content %>%
  plot_common_correlated_words(stop_words_list = custom_stop_words,
                               counts_quantile = 0.75) +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "",
       title = "Commonly Occurring Correlated Words in Congress's Manifesto",
       subtitle = "Per page correlation higher than 0.25",
       caption = "Based on election 2019 manifesto from inc.in") -> p_congress

grid.arrange(p_bjp, p_congress, ncol = 2, widths = c(12,12))
```
<img src="/post/2019-05-13-india-elections-2019-bjp-congress-manifestos-analysis-part-6-national-security_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="1152" />

## Basic Search Engine
Lets build a cosine-similarity based simple search engine (instead of the basic keyword-based search that comes with the pdf document), in order to make these documents more easily searchable and gain context using most related lines in the manifestos for a given query.
Using python’s scikit-learn for this.
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer, ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel

stopwords = ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS

vectorizer_bjp = TfidfVectorizer(analyzer='word', stop_words=stopwords, max_df=0.3, min_df=2)
vector_train_bjp = vectorizer_bjp.fit_transform(r["bjp_content$text"])

vectorizer_congress = TfidfVectorizer(analyzer='word', stop_words=stopwords, max_df=0.3, min_df=2)
vector_train_congress = vectorizer_congress.fit_transform(r["congress_content$text"])

def get_related_lines(query, party="bjp"):
  if (party == "bjp"):
    vectorizer = vectorizer_bjp
    vector_train = vector_train_bjp
  else:
    vectorizer = vectorizer_congress
    vector_train = vector_train_congress
  vector_query = vectorizer.transform([query])
  cosine_sim = linear_kernel(vector_query, vector_train).flatten()
  return cosine_sim.argsort()[:-10:-1]
```
```r
get_related_lines <- py_to_r(py$get_related_lines)
```

### Common Popular Words with both BJP & Congress
As we see from the plot above, one of the most popular words in both BJP and Congress’ is “terrorism”. Lets see, what each of them have planned to combat terrorism. First, BJP.
```r
bjp_content %>%
  slice(get_related_lines("terrorism", party = "bjp")) %>%
  select(text, page, line)
```
```
## # A tibble: 9 x 3
##   text                                                                page  line
##   <chr>                                                              <dbl> <dbl>

```
This is the excerpt that we find from page 38, as we dug up based on above results -
<blockquote>
We are committed to taking concrete steps on international forums against countries and organizations supporting terrorism, and we will take all necessary measures to isolate such countries and organizations on the global stage. To ensure the same, we will work towards establishing a ‘Comity of Nations Against International Terrorism’ as a voluntary multi-lateral forum based on the principles of the draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.
</blockquote>
Now, Congress.
```r
congress_content %>%
  slice(get_related_lines("terrorism", party = "congress")) %>%
  select(text, page, line)
```
```
## # A tibble: 9 x 3
##   text                                                                page  line
##   <chr>                                                              <dbl> <dbl>
## 1 to detect and punish violators and instigators.                       14    53

## 3 streets with a sense of impunity.                                     14    68
## 4 a. we promise an uncompromising approach and                          14    65

```
One of the excerpts from page 14 related to above results -
<blockquote>
The concept of national security in the 21st century has expanded beyond defence of the territory to include data security, cyber security, financial security, communication security and security of trade routes. Congress promises to evolve suitable policies to address each of these subjects.
</blockquote>

### Unique popular words with BJP & Congress
One of the popular words that seems curious from BJP’s manifesto is “police”.
```r
bjp_content %>%
  slice(get_related_lines("police", party = "bjp")) %>%
  select(text, page, line)
```
```
## # A tibble: 9 x 3
##   text                                                                page  line
##   <chr>                                                              <dbl> <dbl>

## 4 modernization of police forces                                        11    26
## 5 challenges.                                                           11    29

## 9 border areas in the country’s development and progress.               12     4
```
An excerpt from BJP’s manifesto about police forces as identified from above -
<blockquote>
We will provide assistance to the states to upgrade their police forces through the ‘Scheme for Modernization of Police Forces’. We will encourage expedited police reforms in the states so as to enable the State police forces to deal with new types of crimes like cyber crime and help them to be more sensitive to the citizens, especially the weak and vulnerable sections of the society.
</blockquote>
Now, one of the popular words that seems curious from Congress’ manifesto is “border”.
```r
congress_content %>%
  slice(get_related_lines("border", party = "congress")) %>%
  select(text, page, line)
```
```
## # A tibble: 9 x 3
##   text                                                                page  line
##   <chr>                                                              <dbl> <dbl>
## 1 26                                                               …    14    75
## 2 bilities of the force and to improve the welfare of our jawans.       15     6
## 3 forces—bsf, ssb, itbp and assam rifles—and                 roads …    15     8
## 4 streets with a sense of impunity.                                     14    68
## 5 and bsf. every effort will be made to induct more          06. we…    15    17

## 8 and living conditions for the forces. the distance               …    15    13
## 9 02. we will construct modern, well-equipped inte-              di…    15    11
```
<blockquote>
We will accelerate the construction of border roads along all borders of India, especially, the India-China border. We will enhance the capacity of the Border Roads Organisation and create separate divisions to build roads along the India-China and the India-Myanmar borders.
</blockquote>
With all the above analysis, we have developed some idea about the National Security goals of the 2 parties. In the next post, I’ll do a similar analysis for Education Healthcare and other miscellaneous proposals by them.
Stay Tuned!
