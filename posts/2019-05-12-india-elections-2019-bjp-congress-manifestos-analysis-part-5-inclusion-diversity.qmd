# Introduction

With India’s 2019 General Elections around the corner, I thought it’d be
a good idea to analyse the election manifestos of its 2 biggest
political parties, BJP and Congress. Let’s use text mining to understand
what each party promises and prioritizes.  
In this part 5, I’ll explore the Inclusion and Diversity discussions in
both manifestos.

# Analysis

## Load libraries

<div id="cb1" class="sourceCode">

``` sourcecode
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(pdftools)
library(tidylog)
library(hunspell)
library(tidytext)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(scales)
library(reticulate)
library(widyr)
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)

theme_set(theme_light())
use_condaenv(&quot;stanford-nlp&quot;)
```

</div>

## Read cleaned data

<div id="cb2" class="sourceCode">

``` sourcecode

congress_content &lt;- read_csv(&quot;../data/indian_election_2019/congress_manifesto_clean.csv&quot;)
```

</div>

## Inclusion and Diversity

This topic is covered congress’ manifesto from Pages 20 to 23 of the pdf
and in that of bjp’s from pages 31 to 35.

<div id="cb3" class="sourceCode">

``` sourcecode
bjp_content %&gt;% 
  filter(between(page, 31, 35)) -&gt; bjp_content

congress_content %&gt;% 
  filter(between(page, 20, 23)) -&gt; congress_content
```

</div>

## Most Popular Words

<div id="cb4" class="sourceCode">

    filter(str_length(word) &gt; 1,
           n &gt; min_count) %&gt;%

                                         stop_words_list = stop_words) {
  set.seed(123)
  df %&gt;% 
    unnest_tokens(word, text) %&gt;% 
    anti_join(stop_words_list) %&gt;% 
    add_count(word) %&gt;% 
    filter(n &gt; stats::quantile(n, counts_quantile)) %&gt;% 
    pairwise_cor(word, page, sort = TRUE) %&gt;%

<div id="cb8" class="sourceCode">

  plot_common_correlated_words(stop_words_list = custom_stop_words,
                               counts_quantile = 0.75) + 
  labs(x = &quot;&quot;,
       y = &quot;&quot;,
       title = &quot;Commonly Occurring Correlated Words in BJP&#39;s Manifesto&quot;,

## Basic Search Engine

Lets build a cosine-similarity based simple search engine (instead of
the basic keyword-based search that comes with the pdf document), in
order to make these documents more easily searchable and gain context
using most related lines in the manifestos for a given query. Using
python’s scikit-learn for this.

<div id="cb9" class="sourceCode">

``` sourcecode
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer, ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel

stopwords = ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS

vectorizer_bjp = TfidfVectorizer(analyzer=&#39;word&#39;, stop_words=stopwords, max_df=0.3, min_df=2)
vector_train_bjp = vectorizer_bjp.fit_transform(r[&quot;bjp_content$text&quot;])

vectorizer_congress = TfidfVectorizer(analyzer=&#39;word&#39;, stop_words=stopwords, max_df=0.3, min_df=2)
vector_train_congress = vectorizer_congress.fit_transform(r[&quot;congress_content$text&quot;])

def get_related_lines(query, party=&quot;bjp&quot;):
  if (party == &quot;bjp&quot;):
    vectorizer = vectorizer_bjp
    vector_train = vector_train_bjp
  else:
    vectorizer = vectorizer_congress
    vector_train = vector_train_congress
  vector_query = vectorizer.transform([query])
  cosine_sim = linear_kernel(vector_query, vector_train).flatten()
  return cosine_sim.argsort()[:-10:-1]
```

</div>

<div id="cb10" class="sourceCode">

``` sourcecode
get_related_lines &lt;- py_to_r(py$get_related_lines)
```

</div>

### Common Popular Words with both BJP & Congress

As we see from the plot above, one of the most popular words in both BJP
and Congress’ manifesto is “women”. Lets see, what each of them have
planned for women in our country. First, BJP.

<div id="cb11" class="sourceCode">

``` sourcecode
bjp_content %&gt;% 
  slice(get_related_lines(&quot;women&quot;, party = &quot;bjp&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  select(text, page, line)
```

</div>

    ## # A tibble: 8 x 3
    ##   text                                                                page  line
    ##   &lt;chr&gt;                                                              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;

    ## 3 strengthen social security mechanism for widows of our ma yrs.        32    16
    ## 4 women empowerment                                                     31     1

This is the excerpt that we find from page 32, as we dug up based on
above results -

> Women’s security will be given more priority. We have constituted the
> Women’s Security Division in the Home Ministry, and have made strict
> provisions for transferring the laws in order to prevent crimes
> against women, in particular in a time-bound investigation and trial
> for rape. In such cases, forensic facilities and fast track courts
> will be expanded to bring convicts to justice.

Now, Congress.

<div id="cb13" class="sourceCode">

``` sourcecode

  slice(get_related_lines(&quot;women&quot;, party = &quot;congress&quot;)) %&gt;%

    ##   &lt;chr&gt;                                                              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;

One of the excerpts from page 21 related to above results -

### Unique popular words with BJP & Congress

One of the popular words that seems curious from BJP’s manifesto is
“families”.

<div id="cb15" class="sourceCode">

``` sourcecode
bjp_content %&gt;% 
  slice(get_related_lines(&quot;families&quot;, party = &quot;bjp&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  select(text, page, line)
```

</div>

    ## # A tibble: 9 x 3
    ##   text                                                                page  line
    ##   &lt;chr&gt;                                                              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;

    ## 3 digit in the next ve years.                                           33    26
    ## 4 ensuring welfare of poor                                              33    24

    ## 9 institution’s curriculum and training modules of public o ces.        32    13

An excerpt from BJP’s manifesto about poor families as identified from
above -

> We have been successful in extending the food security cover to over
> 80 crore people from poor and lower-middle-income families who are
> receiving food grains (wheat/rice/coarse grains) at highly subsidized
> prices. We will further widen this cover to provide subsidized sugar
> (at Rs. 13 per kg per family per month) to these families in line with
> our motto ‘Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikas’.

Now, one of the popular words that seems curious from Congress’
manifesto is “tribes”.

<div id="cb17" class="sourceCode">

``` sourcecode
congress_content %&gt;% 
  slice(get_related_lines(&quot;tribes&quot;, party = &quot;congress&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  select(text, page, line)
```

</div>

    ## # A tibble: 9 x 3
    ##   text                                                                page  line
    ##   &lt;chr&gt;                                                              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
    ## 1 42                                                               …    22    66

    ## 4 compartmental reservation for denotified and                          23    14

    ## 7 06. sufficient night shelters will be built for migrant          …    21    28
    ## 8 the constitution of india provides for reservation in employment …    21    51
    ## 9 social audit of policies and programmes for                           23     4

> Congress promises a Special Census and the enumeration of Denotified
> and Semi-Nomadic Tribes and the integration of the data in the
> decennial census.

With all the above analysis, we have developed some idea about the
Inclusion & Diversity plans of the 2 parties. In the next post, I’ll do
a similar analysis for National Security proposals by them.

Stay Tuned!
