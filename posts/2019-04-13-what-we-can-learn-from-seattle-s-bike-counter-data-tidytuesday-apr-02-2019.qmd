summary: While millions of public dollars are going for bike lanes in Seattle, the
  city's data collection on actual bike-lane ridership is scattered and incomplete.
  Given they're the best the public can get, here's what those numbers can tell us
  about who's riding where.

## Introduction
From the article on [Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/what-we-can-learn-from-seattles-bike-counter-data/) -
“While millions of public dollars are going for bike lanes in Seattle, the city’s data collection on actual bike-lane ridership is scattered and incomplete. Given they’re the best the public can get, here’s what those numbers can tell us about who’s riding where.”

## Analysis
Following along the [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBho2GJE5lc) from [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/drob)
